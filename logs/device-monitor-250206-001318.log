MISO: 12
MOSI: 11
SCK:  13
SS:   10

Be sure to edit DISABLE_CHIP_SELECT if you have
a second SPI device.  For example, with the Ethernet
shield, DISABLE_CHIP_SELECT should be set to 10
to disable the Ethernet controller.

SD chip select is the key hardware option.
Common values are:
Arduino Ethernet shield, pin 4
Sparkfun SD shield, pin 8
Adafruit SD shields and modules, pin 10

Enter the chip select pin number: 1

Assuming the SD is the only SPI device.
Edit DISABLE_CHIP_SELECT to disable another device.

SD initialization failed.
Do not reformat the card!
Is the card correctly inserted?
Is chipSelect set to the correct value?
Does another SPI device need to be disabled?
Is there a wiring/soldering problem?
