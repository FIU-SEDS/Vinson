Adafruit BMP388 / BMP390 test

Could not find a valid BMP3 sensor, check wiring! (Went into infinite loop as it could not find the sensor)


***** IF NOT CHECKING I2C ADDRESS ON SETUP() *****


BMP Perform Reading 
Temperature = 0.00 *C

Pressure = 0.00 hPa

Approx. Altitude = 44330.00 m

readAltitude Function
return 44330.0 * (1.0 - pow(atmospheric / seaLevel, 0.1903));
hence the 44330.00 m
