### GUIDELINES for Setting up Platform.IO

- **Single Main File:** Ensure there is only **ONE** `.cpp` file that contains `setup()` and `loop()` in your `src` directory. Multiple files with these functions will cause compilation errors.
- **Archive Storage:** If files are not intended for compilation, place them in the `archive` folder since only the `src` folder is compiled.
- **Test Folder Usage:** Unless you are actively testing, **do not** place any files in the `test` folder as it may cause errors.
- **Include Folder:** Any custom header files should be placed in the `include` folder, which is recognized by PlatformIO as the location for header files.
- **Corresponding File (.cpp) for Custom Header Files** for the `.cpp` file that corresponds to the header file in the `include` folder make sure that it is placed in the `src` folder so that platformIO can recognize it.

# Commenting Standards

This project uses C, C++, and Arduino code for embedded systems, and we adhere to a consistent commenting style to keep the codebase clear, maintainable, and easy to navigate.

## 1. Function-Level Comments

- **Format:** Use Doxygen-style comments (`/** ... */`) before each function.
- **Content:**
  - Briefly describe the functionâ€™s purpose, parameters, and return values.
  - Use `@brief` to summarize the function at a high level.
  - Use `@param` and `@return` tags to document function inputs/outputs.
  - For any known issues, planned work, or bugs, use `TODO(#issueNumber)` or `FIXME(#issueNumber)`.
  - Use `NOTE(name):` to highlight non-actionable observations or temporary conditions.

**Example:**

```c
/**
 * @brief Fetches data from a sensor and processes the result.
 *
 * Reads from the specified sensor pin, applies filtering, and returns the
 * processed value. This function is non-blocking.
 *
 * @param sensorPin The Arduino analog pin number where the sensor is connected.
 * @return The filtered sensor reading as an integer.
 *
 * NOTE(alice): Currently using a simple moving average filter. See #45 for a discussion on implementing a Kalman filter.
 * TODO(#101): Integrate a calibration routine to improve accuracy.
 * FIXME(#102): Handle sensor saturation conditions more gracefully.
 */
int readAndProcessSensor(int sensorPin) {
    // ...
}
```

## 2. Single-Level Comments (Above or Inline)

- **Format:** Use Doxygen-style comments (`//`) before each comment.
- **Content:**
  - Briefly describe the purpose of the code
  - (Case-by-case basis) Tag anyone who will work on this code

```c
/// This is a single-line Doxygen comment.
/// It documents myOtherVariable.
int myOtherVariable;
```

```c
int myVariable // Place the comment here
```

## 3. TODO Comments

Use TODO(#issueNumber) to mark pending tasks, enhancements, or additional steps you plan to implement.
